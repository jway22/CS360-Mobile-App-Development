# CS360-Mobile-App-Development


- Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

  This app was intended to be an inventory management app. The app would have a login screen, a notifications screen to send SMS notifications to the user, and the inventory screen which would display a table with information taken from a database. The app would give the user the ability to add, delete, and update items within the database.
  
- What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

  The 3 screens metioned above were the necessary screens to create user-centered UI as they are intuitive to use and simple in design. I did my best to make the screens clear so that anyone that used the app could easily figure out what everything did on each screen. I unfortunately had some trouble getting the app fully functional and thus the login screen and notification sign-up screen are the only ones that currently work, but I plan to revisit and fix up the app so that it is fully functioning.
  
- How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

  This app design process followed the class assignments which were very helpful in giving students a new design plan for future apps. I started with coming up with user needs and getting a rough idea of what the app should do and figuring out all of the functionality of the app. Then I designed the UI for each screen so I could plan out what the app would look like and how each screen would move to another screen. This helped me greatly for the final part of the app development where I then coded the functionality of the app. Having the UI designed was a big help for coding because I already knew what I needed each screen, object, etc. to do, I just needed to write the code for the functionality of it.
  
- How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

  Again, I unfortunately had a hard time getting the app fully functional so I wasn't able to test the app as extensively as I would have hoped. I generally tried implementing certain functionality and then running the app and testing that functionality with a couple of tests to make sure the app responded and worked in the way I intended. Since I had trouble getting the app fully working, I was only able to check the login screen and notification screen for functionality. I was able to try different logins and adding users on the login screen which worked in the way that I intended.
  
- Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

  I definitely had to overcome some challenges in the coding aspect of the app development. While I've previously learned a lot of the basics of coding in Java, writing the functionality for .xml files to be incorporated was very new. I spent a lot of time doing more research and watching video tutorials online in order to get aspects of my app functioning in the way that I wanted to.
  
- In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

  Since my login screen is my only truly fully functional screen as of right now, I do think this shows my knowledge and skills as I did incorporate the use of .xml buttons and EditText lines to take user input which then needs to reference a database to compare the input username and password to verify if someone can login to the app. The screen will inform the user if the user doesn't exist or if the username/password is incorrect. It also has the functionality to add a user to the database. This screen not only shows my Java skills but also some of my SQLLite skills and the incorporation of two different languages.
